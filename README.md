# httpArchiveBigQueries
When putting together my new talk for Future of Web Deisgn I needed to get some data together about the performance of the web, to do this I used the HTTP Archive database which can be accessed using Google Big Query. 

So far this repo has queries for the following:

* [renderStart](https://github.com/jonathan-fielding/httpArchiveBigQueries/blob/master/renderStart.md)
* [visualComplete](https://github.com/jonathan-fielding/httpArchiveBigQueries/blob/master/visualComplete.md)
* [onContentLoaded](https://github.com/jonathan-fielding/httpArchiveBigQueries/blob/master/onContentLoaded.md)
